Bigbrother combines the video streams of many androids' cameras, converts them into the open format WebM
and displays them live in your browser using only HTML5 video capabilities. No flash or whatsoever plugin needed.
The location of each recorder is tracked and displayed on a map for convenient selection.

## What did we use?

* arcane constants to get an android to stream video over a socket
* ffmpeg to convert h264 into vp8
* node.js to multiplex the video streams
* html5 video (webm/vp8) to display streamed videos in a browser
